## Notes

This project was generated with [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) app generator.
The project is hosted on [Vercel](https://duggup-rho.vercel.app/) and it's currently ready to deploy.
All Static assets are within the `static` directory.
This page is similar to this [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/u1B8DTArPwpnzBcMR04fvH/Timeline---Duggup?type=design&node-id=7-9899&mode=design&t=G3wlcLCsemy8hbuh-0) page.
The Mobile version needs to be improved.

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
